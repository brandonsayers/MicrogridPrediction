test contains 4500 instances - time series
<power generated (y)> , <temperature>, <windDir>, <windAmp>
Min value from the current data set for power generated is 22. 

All power labels have been subtracted by 22 (the smallest power label) to fit the constraints of the softmax. 
There are some labels that exceed 45 even after subtracting 22, those values are automatically
set to 45 ( the max possible value)
