Data is ommitted from repo.

IMPORTANT:
	* Be sure that all data is removed from the directory before pushing any updates to github. 
	* When incorporating new data, you may have trouble with the range of the classification. 
		In order to mediate such problems, the num of classifications calculation might need 
		to be modified. It is located in control_LSTM under the intiData function. 
		OR search for "num_classes" 

HOW TO:
	incorporate data, create a folder titled "prodData" at the same level of this document. 

	Contents of folder should look like the following:
	prodData -
		/powerGeneratedWindTurbine -
			/powerGeneratedWindTurbine_TEST
			/powerGeneratedWindTurbine_TRAIN

	To change the names, two variables in main.py  must be changed. 
	Look under the getFileInfo() that lives under the mainCTRL class. 
	There you will see a dictionary that defines the directory ("prodData")
	and the dataTargets ("powerGeneratedWindTurbine") - in this example we only have one data target

	The getFileInfo() needs modification so that other libraries can pass in file 
	info attrtibutes. This will be a crucial step when we want to integrate multiple models

About le current (Nov 12,2017) data:
	test contains 5000 instances - time series
	<power generated (y)> , <temperature>, <windDir>, <windAmp>
	Min value from the current data set for power generated is 22. 

	All power labels have been subtracted by 22 (the smallest power label) to fit the constraints of the softmax. 
	There are some labels that exceed 45 even after subtracting 22, those values are automatically
	set to 45 ( the max possible value)
